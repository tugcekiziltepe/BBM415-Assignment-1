Dithering is used to simulate colors or shading. In the quantization process, the discretization method can cause errors due to limited intensity resolution. Dithering is used after quantization so that a kind of “smoothing” is applied to the image. In this part, I've implemented the Floyd-Steinberg dithering algorithm.

I implemented a method that transfers color characteristics of an image to another. Transferring color characteristics of an image to another image is called color transfer. Reinhard proposed a method to transfer color.
